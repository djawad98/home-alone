# Home Alone

Sometimes when your Home-Alone and also hungry, but you have no idea what to cook with some non-relative stuff in your refrigrator. Here's where you can use this app to survive Indigestion or starvation :).

# How does it work?
You give it a few things that you have in your refregrator (excluding skin creams :)), then it will provide you food recipes that match your items. Behind the scene it searches in our humongous database records with an AI-Powered system that will not miss any matching items. Just kidding. By Now there's a static json file with a few food recipes that is begging your contribution :).
